# JustEat Web App

## What is this

This project aims to recreate a CRUD web app inspired in JustEat. Thus, it offers the following functionality:

* **Users**: a profile account is required, so sign-up and log-in functions are available. Users can be created, edited and deleted.
* **Restaurants**: users can create, edit and delete their own restaurant pages. Meanwhile, they can only visit restaurants that are owned by other users. 
* **Dishes**: users can create, edit and delete dishes for the restaurants they own. This way, each restaurant will have a list of dishes attached.
* **Orders**: any user can add any dish from any restaurant to their shopping cart (order). Once done, the order can be submited, being linked to their user profile.
* **Reviews**: retaurants can receive reviews from any user, including a grade and a comment. These reviews can't be edited or deleted.
* **Search**: restaurants can be found by their name, category, location or description.
